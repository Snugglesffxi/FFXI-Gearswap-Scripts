# My personal FFXI Gearswap job scripts for 75 cap

All of my files use Motenten's Library files for gearswap available here: https://github.com/Kinematics/Mote-libs
just click "Code" and then "Download Zip" then extract them into the gearswap/libs folder. 
(they may already be there, if so, this step is not necessary)

What are these files for?

What I mainly use them for are aliases or shortcuts for gear sets. They cut down on the need for excessive functions since certain sets are
pre-defined and will follow their own logic. ie: sets.precast.fastcast doesn't need a precast function, it'll automatically equip fastcast gear during precast.
there is a lot more you can do and utilize with these files, but I mainly just use them for the shortcuts. It doesn't require much overhead and doesn't do
anything that you couldn't macro. Place them in your libs folder and forget it.

For more in-depth information on what you can do with them or how they work go here: https://github.com/Kinematics/GearSwap-Jobs/wiki , but it is not necessary to think much about them except for getting them to use my scripts.

I'm in the process of remaking my job scripts from scratch, it's going to take a while and I'm not sure what will be next, but check back later to see if I have anything new.

Feel free to use these or parts of my code to improve your own scripts.
Happy Gearswapping :)
